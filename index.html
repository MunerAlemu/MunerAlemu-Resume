        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year student at the University of California Riverside working towards my Bachelor's Degree in Biology.<br><br>

        Throughout all the years of my educational career, I have taken the efforts towards succeeding in the future by participating in various work environments. These specific efforts can date back to even high school. During the senior year of my high school career I was fortunate enough to go on a research experiment with a professor along with my classmates to answer a fairly large hypothesis. This research experiment lasted or the duration of it was around three to four months in which the students and this professor would collaborate in person to answer the hypothesis. The second environmental science focused work experience I have participated in is my chemistry lab 1A at the University of California Riverside. This lab was related to my main chemistry course and a discussion course that focused on the basics of chemical sciences and how they apply to our modern day lives. I attended a specific lab session once a week in which the professor or teaching assistant would present to us an experiment for the week and what to do in order to succeed. This course was taken during fall 2021 and ended in that same quarter. Another environmental science focused experience I have is participating in chemistry lab one bean here at the University of California Riverside. This lab is similar to chem 1A which is connected to a lab course and a discussion course. Although the same rules and expectations were met During the course of the class, this course was a lot more fast-paced and included a lot more detail. This lab section was also attended once a week and was taught by a teaching assistant who is involved in our experiments.<br><br>

        The last work experience I have in regards to my major and position is biology lab. This lab was done at the University of California, Riverside and was taken in person and lasted the duration of quarter. Unlike the chemistry labs biology was different in regards to contents and material. In my opinion these biology courses and materials are a lot more difficult to comprehend. The first half of this course was taken online over zoom. Why not actually being on hand in this lab my fellow classmates and I were still able to participate and learn about the concepts and lessons for these experiments.We had worksheets to complete in regards to the information end provided with video materials to re-watch and learn if we had any questions. While these three courses may all have been taken at the University of California Riverside, they all had different impacts on different materials which help me grow as a student in my major and understand the differences between environmental sciences. I'm very glad and proud to say that I had minimal or some work experience during my high school career in order to be somewhat prepared and familiar with the things I would later see in these chemistry and biology labs at my university.
